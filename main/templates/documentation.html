  </div>
  <div class="commands">
    <h2>create</h2>
    <p>
      This command creates a new test. It takes a single required argument `testname`, which specifies the name of the test to be created.
      <br><br>
      To create a test, run the following command:
    </p>
    <p class="command">
      stocktrack create &lt;testname&gt;
    </p>

    <h2>edit</h2>
    <p>
      This command allows the user to edit a previously created test
      <br><br>
      To edit a test, run the following command:
      <br>
      <p class="command">stocktrack edit</p> This will present the user with a list of all the tests they have created and prompt them to
      select the test they want to edit. The selected test will then be opened in a text for the user to edit.
    </p>

    <h2>run</h2>
    <p>
      This command allows the user to run a test. It takes in the following arguments:
      <ul>
        <li>'testname': The name of the tet to be run</li>
        <li>'-o', '--output': The name of the file where the results of the test should be saved. If this argument is not specified, the 
          results are printed to the terminal
        </li>
        <li>'-g', '--graph': Whether or not to generate a graph of the test results.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      To run a test, run the following command:
      <p class="command">stocktrack run</p>
    </p>

    <h2>setdir</h2>
    <p>
      This command allows the user to set the directories where the tests and results are stored. It takes in the following arguments:
      <ul>
        <li>'testdir': The directory where the tests should be stored.</li>
        <li>'resultsdir': The directory where the results should be stored. To set the directories, run the following command:</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p class="command">stocktrack setdir</p>
    </p>

    <h2>results</h2>
    <p>
      This command allows the user to view the results of a previously run test. It presents the user with a list of all the result files 
      in the directory specified by the results_dir.txt file and prompts the user to select the file they want to view. It then displays 
      the contents of the selected file.
      <br><br>
      To view the results of a test, run the following command:
    </p>

    <h2>Account command</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>'account': Returns the email of the active account if the user is signed in.</li>

        <li>'register': Registers an account with the API using the credentials provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Test Language</h2>
    <p>
      Tests are created by writing a script using the test language outlined below. The test language consists of a list of indicators 
      to be used in the test and buy and sell criteria specified using the buy and sell keywords. The criteria can be defined using the 
      crossing and divergence commands, which allow the user to specify conditions based on the values of indicators. The tp sl command 
      can be used to specify take profit and stop loss levels for trades.
      <br><br>
      Here are a few examples of tests written in the test language:
      <br><br>
      <ul class="test-examples">
        <li>
          Example 1:
          <br>
          <p class="code-block">
          use rsi

          buy {
              crossing rsi < 30
          }

          sell {
              crossing rsi > 70
          }
          </p>
          <br>
          This test will buy a stock when the rsi is less than 30 and sell when the rsi is greater than 70.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example 2:
          <br>
          <p class="code-block">
            use macd signal

            buy {
                crossing macd > signal
            }

            sell {
                tp 7% sl -2%
            }
          </p>
          <br>
          This test will buy stock when the macd line crosses the signal line and sell when either the take profit (7%) or the stop loss (-2%) are hit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example 3:
          <br>
          <p class="code-block">
            use rsi

            buy {
                divergence bull rsi 15
            }

            sell {
                crossing rsi > 70
            }
          </p>
          <br>
          This test will buy when there is divergence on the rsi looking back 15 days and sell when/if the rsi goes above 70.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Available indicators</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>rsi</li>
      <li>macd</li>
      <li>signal</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The 'use' keyword is used to specify the indicators to be used in the test. The indicators should be separated by a space.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 'buy' and 'sell' keywords are used to define the criteria for when to buy or sell a stock. The criteria should be defined within curly braces '{}'.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 'crossing' command is used to specify when an indicator crosses a certain value. It takes in two arguments: the indicator and the value.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 'divergence' command is used to specify when there is divergence on an indicator. It takes in three arguments: the type of divergence 
          ('bull' or 'bear'), the indicator to use for the divergence, and the number of days to check back for the divergence.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 'tp sl' command is used to specify the take profit and stop loss levels for a trade. It takes in two arguments: the take 
          profit level and the stop loss level. Both arguments should be specified as a percentage.
